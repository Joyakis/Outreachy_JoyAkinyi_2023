Welcome to my Geospatial Analysis and Mapping repository! This repo contains scripts and tools for processing and analyzing geographic data, as well as creating visual representations of that data in the form of maps. My aim is to provide a user-friendly platform for geospatial analysis and mapping that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of expertise.

This tools can be used for a variety of applications, such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, distribution of physical features, and more. It also offers various geospatial analysis techniques such as geocoding. The mapping capabilities allow you to create custom maps with various layers and overlays to better visualize and understand your data.

This repository provides a useful resource for anyone interested in exploring and analyzing geographic data and is done as a prerequisite to join outreachy internship program under mojaglobal.The data was obtained from the mojaglobal host drive
