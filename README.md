# Outreachy_JoyAkinyi_2023

Welcome to my Geographical repository! This repo contains jupyter notebooks as well as htmlslides.The notebook analysed geographic data, as well as creating visual representations of that data in the form of maps. My aim is to be able to communicate data efficiently and smoothly,and draw meaningful insights

The various tools  used include python libraries such as pandas,For visualisation i used matplotlib.I also incorporated geopandas since it involves the drawing of maps.  The mapping capabilities allow you to create custom maps with various layers and overlays to better visualize and understand your data.

This repository provides a useful resource for anyone interested in exploring and analyzing geographic data and is done as a prerequisite to join outreachy internship program under mojaglobal and the data was obtained from the mojaglobal host drive
